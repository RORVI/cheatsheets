## What is Emmet?
Emmet is a plug-in for speeding up development with HTML, CSS, XML, and most derivations of handlebars. It is basically a superset for these languages, allowing developers to generate certain structures of code with simple 'formulas', thus speeding up the coding process for front end applications.

## These shortcuts will work in the following contexts:
* HTML files (*.html* extension)
* CSS files (*.css* extension)
* Typescript files (*.ts* extension)
* A file which comprises a combination of HTML and CSS (*.html* extension)
* XML files (*.xml* extension)
* less files (*.scss* extension)
* sass files (*.less* extension)
