## What is Emmet?
Emmet is a plug-in for speeding up development with HTML, CSS, XML, and most derivations of handlebars. It is basically a superset for these languages, allowing developers to generate certain structures of code with simple 'formulas', thus speeding up the coding process for front end applications.

## These shortcuts will work in the following contexts:
* HTML files (<pre>.html</pre> extension)
* CSS files (<pre>.css</pre> extension)
* Typescript files (<pre>.ts</pre> extension)
* A file which comprises a combination of HTML and CSS (<pre>.html</pre> extension)
* XML files (<pre>.xml</pre> extension)
* less files (<pre>.scss</pre> extension)
* sass files (<pre>.less</pre> extension)
